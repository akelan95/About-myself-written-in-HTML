  <div id="Introduction">
    <h2><em>About myself</em></h2>
    <p>I am a <strong><em>motivated</em></strong> and <strong><em>proactive</em></strong> Translation Studies German graduate from <strong>Aston University</strong> with a
      year abroad experience in Germany having gained valuable experiences in marketing and project management.<br><br>
      After I had graduated from University, I had worked in Finance and Market Research, whilst I enjoyed working with interesting projects, I realised that I wanted to
      solve more complex problems and be creative as well as challenge myself.<br><br>
      I always wanted to work in the Technology industry as I strongly believe that technology is and will be an integral, guiding force in society and in our lifes.<br><br>
      In March 2020, I decided to learn <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> using Udemy and Coursera courses, I wanted to become more familiar in using databases and Python.
      <br><br>
      Now, I am currently studying in becoming a Front-End Developer through self-study.<br><br>

  <div id="Web Development Journey">
    <h2><em>Why did I chose Web Development?</em></h2>
    <p>After completing these two courses, I had started another course on computer science fundamentals using CS50 lecture resources by Harvard University. <br><br>
      These lectures were great as I was able to understand how a computer works underneath the hood by working with topics such as Compilers, Algorithms and Data Structures.<br><br>
      Once I was finished, I researched into seeing how I could possibly start a career in Technology and I decided to follow a Web Development Path using Codecademy as one
      of my resources.<br><br>
      I chose this path as I was intrigued into understanding how websites were built and I first started to learn how the internet works by touching base
      on topics such as Servers and HTTP.<br><br>
      I am currently studying HTML as one of the web development languages using Codecademy.
